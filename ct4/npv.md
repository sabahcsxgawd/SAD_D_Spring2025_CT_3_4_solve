## **(i) Textual Cash Flow Diagram Construction**

We'll list the **cash inflows (revenues)** and **cash outflows (costs)** by year:

| **Year** | **Cash Inflows (Revenue)** | **Cash Outflows (Costs)**         | **Net Cash Flow** |
| -------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| 0        | \$0                        | **\$30,000 (initial investment)** | **–\$30,000**     |
| 1        | \$10,000                   | \$0                               | \$10,000          |
| 2        | \$15,000                   | **\$5,000 (operational)**         | \$10,000          |
| 3        | \$20,000                   | \$0                               | \$20,000          |
| 4        | \$25,000                   | **\$7,000 (upgrade)**             | \$18,000          |
| 5        | \$35,000                   | \$0                               | \$35,000          |

### **Textual Representation of the Cash Flow Diagram**

* **Time 0 (Now):** Outflow of \$30,000 (investment)
* **Year 1:** Inflow of \$10,000
* **Year 2:** Inflow of \$15,000, Outflow of \$5,000 → Net Inflow = \$10,000
* **Year 3:** Inflow of \$20,000
* **Year 4:** Inflow of \$25,000, Outflow of \$7,000 → Net Inflow = \$18,000
* **Year 5:** Inflow of \$35,000

## **(ii) NPV Calculation**

We’ll calculate the Net Present Value (NPV) using the formula:

$$
NPV = \sum_{t=0}^{n} \frac{C_t}{(1 + r)^t}
$$

Where:

* $C_t$ = net cash flow at year $t$
* $r$ = discount rate = 10% = 0.10
* $n$ = 5 years

---

### **Step-by-step NPV Calculation**

* **Year 0:** $\frac{-30,000}{(1 + 0.10)^0} = -30,000$
* **Year 1:** $\frac{10,000}{(1 + 0.10)^1} = 9,090.91$
* **Year 2:** $\frac{10,000}{(1 + 0.10)^2} = 8,264.46$
* **Year 3:** $\frac{20,000}{(1 + 0.10)^3} = 15,026.31$
* **Year 4:** $\frac{18,000}{(1 + 0.10)^4} = 12,285.43$
* **Year 5:** $\frac{35,000}{(1 + 0.10)^5} = 21,712.57$

---

### **Summing Up**

$$
NPV = -30,000 + 9,090.91 + 8,264.46 + 15,026.31 + 12,285.43 + 21,712.57
$$

$$
NPV = \boxed{36,379.68}
$$

## ✅ **Conclusion:**

Since the **NPV is positive (\$36,379.68)**, the project is **financially sustainable** and **worth pursuing** based on these assumptions and projections.
